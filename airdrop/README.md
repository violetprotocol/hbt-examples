# Sybil-resistant Airdrop with Humanbound Tokens

## How to Use

It's required that you have `yarn` installed. If you don't, simply run `npm i -g yarn`.

### Installing all dependencies
```
yarn install
```

### Running the app
You can run the backend, frontend, and local blockchain node all from 1 single terminal instance.
To do so, run the following command from your project's root directory.

```bash
yarn dev
```

This utilizes a package called `concurrently` that allows you to concurrently run all instances from a single terminal.

Once the app is running, you can view at:

- Frontend <http://localhost:3000>
- Backend <http://localhost:5000>
